### Research Interests

My current research interests lie in the general area of natural language processing, particularly in 1) fine-grained opinion mining, 2) efficient pre-trained language models for information retrieval, and 3) machine learning for robustness. Prior to devoting myself to natural language processing, I did a variety of work on game AI.
