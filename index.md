### Research Interests

My current research interests lie in the general area of natural language processing, particularly in fine-grained opinion mining. Recently, I focus on robust opinion mining, especially in terms of adversarial and distributional robustness. Prior to devoting myself to natural language processing, I did a variety of work on game AI.
