### About Me

I am currently a Ph.D. student at Beijing Institute of Technology (BIT), where I am advised by [Prof. Dawei Song](http://cs.bit.edu.cn/szdw/jsml/js/sdw/index.htm), and collaborate with [Dr. Qiuchi Li](https://qiuchili.github.io) and [Prof. Benyou Wang](https://wabyking.github.io/old) broadly on various topics. I also collaborate with [Dr. Jingang Wang](https://sites.google.com/site/bitwjg/) on and [Dr. Wei Wu](https://sites.google.com/view/wei-wu-homepage) on generalization and accelaration of pretrained language models at Meituan NLP. You can contact me via czhang[AT]bit[DOT]edu[DOT]cn.

### Recent Highlights

* Mar. 31st, 2022. One long paper got accepted to [SIGIR 2022](https://sigir.org/sigir2022/program/accepted/).
* Dec. 27th, 2021. Help to develope *WenJin*, which has reached the first place (as of the time) on [CLUE classification benchmark](https://www.cluebenchmarks.com/classification.html).
* Nov. 29th, 2021. Glad to join the Elite Ph.D. Program at BIT.
* Oct. 15th, 2021. Attended NLPCC 2021 and gave an oral presentation online.
* July 30th, 2021. One regular paper got accepted to [NLPCC 2021](http://tcci.ccf.org.cn/conference/2021/).

### Education

* Sep. 2021 - Present, Ph.D. in Computer Science, Beijing Institute of Technology.
* Sep. 2019 - July 2021, M.Eng. in Computer Science, Beijing Institute of Technology.
* Sep. 2015 - July 2019, B.Eng. in Electrical Engineering, Beijing Institute of Technology.

### Research Interests

My current research interests lie in the general area of natural language processing, particularly in 1) fine-grained opinion mining, 2) generalization and accelaration of pretrained language models. Prior to devoting myself to natural language processing, I did a variety of work on game AI.
